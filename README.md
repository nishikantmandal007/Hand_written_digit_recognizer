# MNIST Digit Recognition using TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of a flattening layer followed by two dense layers with ReLU activation functions and a final output layer with softmax activation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
